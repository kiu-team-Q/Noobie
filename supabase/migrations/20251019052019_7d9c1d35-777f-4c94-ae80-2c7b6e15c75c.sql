-- This migration will be used to seed test data through proper auth signup
-- The actual user creation must happen through Supabase Auth, not direct INSERT

-- For now, let's just document that test users should be created via:
-- 1. Sign up through the app with invite tokens
-- 2. Or use Supabase Auth Admin API

-- This is a placeholder migration to acknowledge the seeding request
-- Real seeding requires auth.users entries which can only be created through Supabase Auth
